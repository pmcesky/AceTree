	ctrl-right arrow --- move nucleus to the right by 1
	ctrl-up arrow --- move nucleus up by 1
	ctrl-down arrow --- move nucleus down by 1
	
	shift-left arrow --- decrease nucleus diameter by 2
	shift-right arrow --- increase nucleus diameter by 2
	shift-up arrow --- move up nucleus in Z axis by 1
	shift-down arrow --- move down nucleus in Z axis by 1

	delete/backspace --- kill selected nucleus
